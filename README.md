# Welocome to  my GitHub profile !!

My name is Wojciech and I was born in Poland, but for more than a decade, I'm living in Utrecht in the Netherlands. With multiple years of experience in logistics and warehousing, I'm currently on my way to become a Full Stack Web Developer. I'm getting closer to the finishing line of 11 weeks long Coding Academy @Codaisseur. I know that it just the beginning of my new path but I'm excited about that journey! :)
